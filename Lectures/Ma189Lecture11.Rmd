# Comparing More Than Two Populations

- We have learned how to test if one population mean vector equals a specific vector
\[
 H_0: \underline{\mu}^{(1)} = \underline{\mu}_0 \quad H_a: \underline{\mu}^{(1)} \neq \underline{\mu}_0.
\]
- Also, we have learned how to test if two populations have equal mean vectors
\[
 H_0: \underline{\mu}^{(1)} = \underline{\mu}^{(2)} \quad H_a: \underline{\mu}^{(1)} \neq \underline{\mu}^{(2)}.
\]
- What if we want to test the equivalence of mean vectors among three or more populations?
- Suppose $\underline{\mu}^{(1)}, \ldots, \underline{\mu}^{(g)}$  are mean vectors of $g$ populations. We are interested in testing
\[
 H_0: \underline{\mu}^{(1)} = \ldots = \underline{\mu}^{(g)} 
 \quad H_a: \underline{\mu}^{(i)} \neq \underline{\mu}^{(j)} \; \mbox{for some} \, i \neq j.
\]
- The null hypothesis assumes all mean vectors to be the same. The null hypothesis is false
(alternative is true) if any two mean vectors are different.

## Example: Romano-British Pottery Data

- Romano-British Pottery shards are collected from four sites in the British Isles:

1. L: Llanedeyrn
2. C: Caldicot
3. I: Isle Thorns
4. A: Ashley Rails

![SwissFrance](images/pottery.jpg)

- Each pottery sample was returned to the laboratory for a chemical test. In these tests the concentrations of five different chemicals were measured:

1. Al: Aluminum
2. Fe: Iron
3. Mg: Magnesium
4. Ca: Calcium
5. Na: Sodium

- Does the chemical content of the pottery depend on the site where the pottery was discovered?
If yes, we can use the chemical content of a pottery sample of unknown origin to determine which site the sample came from.

## A Peek at the Data

Adopted from: Tubb, A., A. J. Parker, and G. Nickless. 1980. "The Analysis of Romano-British Pottery by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry". *Archaeometry* 22: 153-71.

```{r}
pottery <- read.csv("RBPottery.csv")
colnames(pottery) <- c("No", "ID", "Kiln", "Al", "Fe", "Mg", "Ca", "Na", "K2O", "TiO2", "MnO", "BaO")
pot_llan <- pottery[pottery$Kiln==2,]
pot_cald <- pottery[pottery$Kiln==3,]
pot_is <- pottery[pottery$Kiln==4,]
pot_ar <- pottery[pottery$Kiln==5,]
pottery[c(23,37,39,44),4:8]
```

Dataset contains $26$ ancient pottery shards found at four sites in British Isles. For each of $26$ samples of pottery, the percentages of oxides of five metals are measured.
 
# Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

- ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) is a set of statistical tools used to analyze the differences
among population means given their samples. *ANOVA* is useful for comparing (testing) three or
more group means for statistical significance.
- ANOVA was developed by British statistician Ronald Fisher.
- ANOVA is conceptually similar to multiple two-sample tests, but is more conservative (fewer
type I errors). It is suited to a wide range of practical problems.

## Univariate ANOVA

- We begin with the univariate case. Suppose we have $g$ treatments (samples). For the $k$th treatment, we observe its effects on a group of patients of size $n_k$. The dataset
can be summarized in the following table.
\[
 \left[ \begin{array}{ccccc}   & 1 & 2 & \ldots & g \\
    1 & x_{11} & x_{12} & \ldots & x_{1g} \\
    2 & x_{21} & x_{22} & \ldots & x_{2g} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    n_k & x_{n_1,1} & x_{n_2,1} & \ldots & x_{n_g, g} 
\end{array}  \right]
\]


### Notation:

- $x_{ik}$ is $i$th observation in $k$th sample
- $n_k$ is number of observations in $k$th sample
- $N = n_1 + \ldots + n_g$ is total sample size
- $g$ is the  number of treatments/populations/samples

### Assumptions for the ANOVA:

1. The data from group $k$ has common mean $\mu_k$, i.e., ${\mathbb E} [ x_{ik} ] = \mu_k$.
2. *Homoskedasticity*: the data from all groups have common variance $\sigma^2$.
3. Independence: the observations are independently sampled.
4. Normality: the data are normally distributed.

The hypothesis of interest is that all of the means are equal. Mathematically this is formulated as:
\[
 H_0: \ {\mu}^{(1)} = \ldots = \ {\mu}^{(g)} 
 \quad H_a: \ {\mu}^{(i)} \neq \ {\mu}^{(j)} \; \mbox{for some} \, i \neq j.
\]
- The alternative hypothesis indicates there exists at least one pair of different
group population means.

## Total Sum of Squares

- Consider the following notation:
\[
 \overline{x}_k = \frac{1}{n_k} \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} x_{ik}, 
\]
 the sample mean of the $k$th sample.
\[
 \overline{x} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^g \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} x_{ik}, 
\] 
the grand mean (or, the overall sample mean).
- The Analysis of Variance involves a partitioning of the total sum of squares, defined as:
\[
 \mbox{SS}_{total} = \sum_{k=1}^g \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} {( x_{ik} - \overline{x} )}^2.
 \]
- $\mbox{SS}_{total}$ is the sum of squared differences between each observation and the
grand mean, which measures variation of the data around the grand mean.
- When observations are far away from the grand mean, it tends to take a large value.
- When observations are close to the grand mean, it tends to take a small value.

## Partitioning Total Sum of Squares

- An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a partitioning of the total sum of squares.
\begin{align}
  \mbox{SS}_{total} & = \sum_{k=1}^g \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} {( x_{ik} - \overline{x} )}^2 \\
& =  \sum_{k=1}^g \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} {[ ( x_{ik} - \overline{x}_k ) - (\overline{x}_k - \overline{x} ) ]}^2 \\
 & = \sum_{k=1}^g \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} { ( x_{ik} - \overline{x}_k )}^2 +
   \sum_{k=1}^g n_k {  (\overline{x}_k - \overline{x} )  }^2.
\end{align}
- The first term is called the *error sum of squares* and measures the variation in the data
about their group means. Denoted as $\mbox{SS}_{error}$.
- The second term is called the *treatment sum of squares* and involves the differences
between the group means and the Grand mean. Denoted as  $\mbox{SS}_{treat}$.
- Error sum of squares ($\mbox{SS}_{error}$) measures the within-group variability.
- Treatment sum of squares ($\mbox{SS}_{treat}$) measures the between-group variability.

### Intuitions

- When the null hypothesis is true, i.e.
\[
 H_0: \ {\mu}^{(1)} = \ldots = \ {\mu}^{(g)} 
 \quad H_a: \ {\mu}^{(i)} \neq \ {\mu}^{(j)} \; \mbox{for some} \, i \neq j,
\]
we would expect the between-group variability to be small and within-group variability to be large.
- On the other hand, when the null hypothesis is false, we would expect the between-group variability to be large and within-group variability to be small.

## A Simulated Example

- We simulate two datasets, each contains two samples (to compare).
- Here we draw the histogram for each dataset.
- Can you tell if the population means of the two samples are equal or not?

```{r}
# Generate simulations
n <- 500
x1 <- cbind(matrix(rnorm(n*1,-0.5,2),n,1),
            matrix(rnorm(n*1,0.5,2),n,1))
x2 <- cbind(matrix(rnorm(n*1,-2,1),n,1),
            matrix(rnorm(n*1,2,1),n,1))

# Data visualization via histograms
hist(rbind(x1[,1],x1[,2]), breaks=20, xlim=c(-5,5),ylim=c(0,0.5),freq = F,
     main="Histogram of Sample 1", xlab="", col=rgb(1,0,0,0.5))
hist(rbind(x2[,1],x2[,2]), breaks=20, xlim=c(-5,5),ylim=c(0,0.5),freq = F,
     main="Histogram of Sample 2", xlab="", col=rgb(1,0,0,0.5))
```

### True Data Generating Process

```{r}
nv <- c(n,n)
center_x1 <- x1 - matrix(colMeans(x1), nr=dim(x1)[1], nc=dim(x1)[2], byrow=TRUE)
center_x2 <- x2 - matrix(colMeans(x2), nr=dim(x2)[1], nc=dim(x2)[2], byrow=TRUE)
ESS1 <- sum(center_x1^2)
TSS1 <- nv%*%(colMeans(x1)-mean(x1))^2
ESS2 <- sum(center_x2^2)
TSS2 <- nv%*%(colMeans(x2)-mean(x2))^2
```

- Dataset 1:
1. Sample 1 is generated from $\mathcal{N} (−0.5, 2^2)$. The sample size is $500$.
2. Sample 2 is generated from $\mathcal{N} (0.5, 2^2)$. The sample size is $500$.
3. $\mbox{SS}_{error}$ `r ESS1` Large within-group variability.
4. $\mbox{SS}_{treat}$ `r TSS1`  Small between-group variability.

- Dataset 2:
1. Sample 1 is generated from $\mathcal{N}(−2, 1^2)$. The sample size is $500$.
2. Sample 2 is generated from $\mathcal{N}(2, 1^2)$. The sample size is $500$.
3. $\mbox{SS}_{error}$  `r ESS2` Small within-group variability.
4. $\mbox{SS}_{treat}$  `r TSS2` Large between-group variability.

Both datasets have un-equal population means. Why is this easier to discern in the second dataset?

### Distinguish with Colors

Now we use red and blue to discriminate the two samples:
- The red dashed line denotes the true population mean of each sample.
- Error sum of squares ($\mbox{SS}_{error}$) measures within-group variability.
- Treatment sum of squares ($\mbox{SS}_{treat}$) measures between-group variability.


```{r}
# Data visualization via histograms
hist(x1[,1], breaks=20, xlim=c(-5,5),ylim=c(0,0.5),freq = F,
     main="Histogram of Sample 1", xlab="", col=rgb(1,0,0,0.5))
hist(x1[,2], breaks=20, col=rgb(0,0,1,0.5),freq = F, add=T )
abline(v = -0.5, col="red", lwd=2, lty=2)
abline(v = 0.5, col="red", lwd=2, lty=2)

hist(x2[,1], breaks=20, xlim=c(-5,5),ylim=c(0,0.5),freq = F,
     main="Histogram of Sample 2", xlab="", col=rgb(1,0,0,0.5))
hist(x2[,2], breaks=20, col=rgb(0,0,1,0.5),freq = F, add=T)
abline(v = -1, col="red", lwd=2, lty=2)
abline(v = 1, col="red", lwd=2, lty=2)
```

## Design of Test Statistic
 
- Motivated by this toy example, we should reject the null hypothesis when the Treatment Sum of
Squares ($\mbox{SS}_{treat}$) is large. Given the same level of total sum of squares, a large $\mbox{SS}_{treat}$ will result $\mbox{SS}_{error}$.
- We want to find a test statistic which is proportional to $\mbox{SS}_{treat}$ and inversely proportional to $\mbox{SS}_{error}$.
- A naive approach is to use the ratio
\[
  \mbox{SS}_{treat} / \mbox{SS}_{error}.
\]

### Calculation for Simulated Datasets:

- Dataset 1: $\mbox{SS}_{treat} / \mbox{SS}_{error}$ `r TSS1/ESS1`
- Dataset 2: $\mbox{SS}_{treat} / \mbox{SS}_{error}$ `r TSS2/ESS2`

#### Some problems:

1. Both ratios are very small! This can make the test insensitive!
2. $\mbox{SS}_{error}$ is sensitive to the size of each sample $n_i$, while $\mbox{SS}_{treat}$ is less sensitive to $n_i$. Therefore, this ratio will be sensitive to the sample sizes $n_i$, which is not ideal.

#### Solution:

1. We rescale the sum of squares by dividing their degrees of freedom.
2. Change from ratio between sum of squares to the ratio between mean of squares.

## Degrees of Freedom (DOF)

- We check the degrees of freedom of these sum of squares
- Error sum of squares
\[
 \mbox{SS}_{error} = \sum_{k=1}^g \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} { ( x_{ik} - \overline{x}_k )}^2 \sim \chi^2_{N-g}.
\]
- Treatment sum of squares
\[
 \mbox{SS}_{treat} =  \sum_{k=1}^g n_k {  (\overline{x}_k - \overline{x} )  }^2 \sim \chi^2_{g-1}.
\]
- Total sum of squares
\[
 \mbox{SS}_{total}  = \sum_{k=1}^g \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} {( x_{ik} - \overline{x} )}^2  \sim \chi^2_{N-1}.
\]
- Therefore, the three degrees of freedom satisfy
\[
 \mbox{DF}_{total} = \mbox{DF}_{treat} + \mbox{DF}_{error}.
\]
 
## An F-Statistic as the Ratio of Means of Squares

- Error mean of squares
\[
 \mbox{MS}_{error} = \frac{1}{N-g} \mbox{SS}_{error} =
 \frac{1}{N-g} \sum_{k=1}^g \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} { ( x_{ik} - \overline{x}_k )}^2.
\]
- Treatment mean of squares
 \[
 \mbox{MS}_{treat}  = \frac{1}{g-1} \mbox{SS}_{treat} = 
 \frac{1}{g-1} \sum_{k=1}^g n_k {  (\overline{x}_k - \overline{x} )  }^2.
\]
- Then we can define an $F$-statistic as the ratio between $\mbox{MS}_{treat}$ and $\mbox{MS}_{error}$:
\[
 F = \frac{ \mbox{MS}_{treat} }{ \mbox{MS}_{error} } \sim \mathcal{F}_{g-1,N-g}.
\]
- At significance level $\alpha$ we reject the null hypothesis  $H_0$ if
\[
  F > \mathcal{F}_{g-1,N-g,\alpha}.
\]

## Example: Romano-British Pottery Data

Question: Which chemical element varies significantly across sites?
- As a naive approach to assess the significance of individual variables (chemical elements), we consider the following univariate multisample testing:  
\[
  H_0^{(j)}:  \mu_{1j} = \mu_{2j} = \ldots = \mu_{gj}
\]
 for variables $1 \leq j \leq m$.
 
- For the $j$th chemical, we apply a univariate ANOVA and calculate an $F$-statistic $F^{(j)}$,
for   $1 \leq j \leq m$.
- For a significance level $\alpha$, we reject the null hypothesis $H_0^{(j)}$ if
\[
  F^{(j)} > \mathcal{F}_{g-1,N-g,\alpha}.
\]

- Sounds like a good plan?  What about FWER? 
- To control the type I errors among multiple testing, we can utilize Bonferroni correction.
- To control the FWER at level $\alpha$, we adjust the significance level for each individual
test to $\alpha/m$ instead of $\alpha$.
- At a significance level $\alpha$, we reject the null hypothesis $H_0^{(j)}$ if
\[
  F^{(j)} > \mathcal{F}_{g-1,N-g,\alpha/m}.
\]

- Other type I error control methods can also be applied depending on your goals. 
- The Pottery data contains $m=5$ variables, $g=4$ groups, and a total number of $N=26$ observations.
For an $\alpha = 0.05$ level test, we reject the $j$th null hypothesis $H_0^{(j)}$ if
\[
 F^{(j)} > \mathcal{F}_{3,22,.01},  
\]
 which equals `r qf(.99,df=3,df2=22)`.

- The testing results are listed below. As all $F$ statistics `r c(F1,F2,F3,F4,F5)` exceed the critical value `r qf(.99,df=3,df2=22)`, we reject all the null hypotheses. 

**Conclusion**: All chemical elements differ significantly among the sites. Each element is significantly different between at least one pair of sites.
