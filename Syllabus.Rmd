## **MATH 189 Syllabus (Winter 2020)**

### **Exploratory Data Analysis and Inference** 
Lectures: MWF 4:00-4:50

### Course Catalog Description
An introduction to various quantitative methods and statistical techniques for analyzing data—in particular big data. Quick review of probability continuing to topics of how to process, analyze, and visualize data using statistical language R. Further topics include basic inference, sampling, hypothesis testing, bootstrap methods, and regression and diagnostics. Offers conceptual explanation of techniques, along with opportunities to examine, implement, and practice them in real and simulated data.

### Prerequisites
MATH 18 or MATH 20F or MATH 31AH, and MATH 20C and one of BENG 134, CSE 103, ECE 109, ECON 120A, MAE 108, MATH 180A, MATH 183, MATH 186, or SE 125. Students who have not completed listed prerequisites may enroll with consent of instructor.

### Overview
The goal of the course is to both provide the theoretical foundation for common statistical methods and train students in data analysis.  Topics include probability, inference, hypothesis testing, and linear models, explicated through case studies.  Class time will be divided between lectures presenting new methods, and
demonstrations of examples (in R or Python).

Students are expected to master the concepts described in class, and be able to apply this knowledge to data; finally, students are expected to create reports that summarize their findings.  To that end, students are expected to understand, write, debug, and apply (R or Python) code to analyze data.
 
### Learning Outcomes
At the completion of the course, students will acquire the following skills:

1. Understand and speak the basic language of statistics
2. Appreciate the strengths and limitations of different methods, and formulate conclusions accordingly
3. Perform statistical data analysis 
4. Formulate conclusions in a statistical report (e.g. R Markdown)
5. Learn to use open source software (R or Python) for data analysis

 Tucker S. McElroy is Senior Time Series Mathematical Statistician at the U.S. Census Bureau, where he has contributed to developing time series research and software for the last 17 years. Before Census, Tucker was a faculty fellow at UCSD, after receiving his PhD in mathematics in 2001. 
 <!-- He has published more than 80 papers and is a recipient of the Arthur S. Flemming award (2011). -->
 
### Text
There is no required text.  The bookstore has copies available of the introductory text *Exploratory Data Analysis with R*, by Roger D. Peng.  Also available at https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/exdata/
 
### Grading
40% homework, 20% quiz, 40% final project.

*Homework*: Students will work in groups of 3 to 5, collaborating to prepare a single R Markdown report.  Each assignment involves some data analysis.  There will be one assignment every two weeks (4 assignments, each worth 10% of final grade).

*Quiz*: There will be a weekly quiz, either on Friday or in section.  

*Project*: Students will work alone on a final project, analyzing a data set and summarizing results in an R Markdown report.

### Course website
All the lecture notes and class information will be available through the instructor's GitHub: https://github.com/tuckermcelroy.  We will be using Piazza for forum-type discussions throughout the quarter. All posts will be anonymous to the student users but not the TAs and the instructor.
 

### Schedule
Each 50-minute lesson will cover theoretical material in an R Notebook (which will be posted on the GitHub), allowing us to click through code that demonstrates the mathematics.

1. **Introduction** Policies and course goals.  Discussion of languages (R and Python), IDE (RStudio and PyCharm), generating reports (R Markdown), and GitHub.
2. **Case Study 1** Random variables and random vectors.  Demo in R/Python.
3. **Case Study 1** Mean and Covariance.  Demo in R/Python. 
4. **Case Study 1** Inference and hypotheses.  Downloading from American Factfinder.
5. **Case Study 1** Order statistics and ranking.    
6. **Case Study 1** Normal Approximations.   
7. **MLK Holiday**
